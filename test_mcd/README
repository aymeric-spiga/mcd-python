test_mcd.py        Example of a python script calling the mcd
test_mcd.def       Example of user inputs to test_mcd.py

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
====================
The test_mcd.py python script is an illustrative example of how one may
call upon the fortran routine call_mcd.F (as well as the Julian.F routine)
to retreive data from the Mars Climate Database.

USAGE:
======
The "test_mcd.py" script provides a simple and straightforward example of
how one can call the mcd from within a python script. When run it requires
some input from the user (hence the "test_mcd.def" file, for those who prefer
to redirect input from a file rather than type as the program proceeds).
